# lazyload

v1.0.0 / 2016-12-07

Simple, no dependency, lazy loader. Swaps `data-src/data-srcset` on `img`, `source` and `iframes` to `src/srcset`. Adds a load listener and removes the `data-` attribute on load. If `data-srcset` to `srcset` and [picturefill](https://github.com/scottjehl/picturefill) is present, attempts to run picturefill on the element.
